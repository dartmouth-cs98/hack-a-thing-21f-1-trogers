## What you learned

I am into this project with no experience in Unity or any game design. First, I learned about the Unity platfrom and all of the different windows with are neccessary for game development. I learned how to create game objects, backgrounds, and animations based off of sprite pages and background photos. Next, I learned the bassic syntax for C# including important principles for game design such as class inheritances which are used for character creation. Using this new knowledge of C#, I created scripts which governed the play of my game and learned how to access the attributes of the game objects within these scripts in order to handle collisions or change movements. I created prefabs for ghosts and players such that they could easily be reused and spawned as desired. Finally, I learned how to change the physics of the game, such as changing the gravity, mass, or dynamics for a specific character.
